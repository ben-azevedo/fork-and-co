# Project Overview

## Project Name

Recipe Generator

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API and Data Sample

This project was built-out using spoonacular API, which can be found here: https://spoonacular.com/food-api. This particular API allows for three different types of recipe searches: by name, by nutrients involved, and by ingredients used. And to ```GET``` the actual recipes and ingredient list of each response requires an additional call to the API.

Here is an example of an advanced HTTP request that combines the name, nutrients, and ingredients searches (https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch+{foodName}+{nutrients}+{ingredients}). You can expect a response of:
```

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow users to filter their recipe search by name, nutrients, or ingredients
- Rank recipes by their spoonacular score

#### PostMVP  

- Allow users to further filter their results by cuisines, diets, intolerances, etc.
- Allow users to bookmark recipes found during their browser session
- Advanced CSS styling and animation

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Dec 17| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Dec 21| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Dec 22| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Dec 23| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Dec 23| MVP | Incomplete
|Jan 21| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
